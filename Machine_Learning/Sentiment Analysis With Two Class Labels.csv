"So yesterday, I spent most of my working time testing and debugging the new code I wrote to automatically log a user back in when they time out, AND run whatever command they were trying to run when the program realized they'd timed out. The login part works great! And the running the command part works too - as long as there's only ONE command. If a single action, like a click, triggers TWO commands - like for instance, if clicking anywhere in a widget selects it, and clicking a button within it also contacts the DB - then only the first one runs and I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY. I can't debug it because every time I pause the code to step through it, the behavior changes! I suppose that in itself helps me narrow it down some - it must be a timing issue in some way - but I'm really stumped. I'll work on it some more today, I guess. I hate bugs I can't trace well, I feel like I don't have a good handle on how to find them. I mostly just stare at the code until inspiration strikes.",NEGATIVE,0.9989030361175537

I had been talking to someone who I had thought was a friend but they wound up telling lies. The friendship had turned quickly into something of a relationship more on their end and lies were told by me in order for them to send me money. I finally decided to tell them that I wanted to have the truth and honesty back which now has become very dramatic and time consuming. It is frustrating because they continue to play the victim despite the lies told by them and each conversation just goes in circles. I thought being honest was the best interest for the both of us but it seems to make things worse.I am frustrated that they do not see their wrong doings and due to me telling the truth they continue to bring up their hurt feelings and not acknowledging mine. I tried to block them and just stop speaking but was told to try and get more money from them which is what made things go horribly wrong but they did not even notice they were not even talking to me at all. They have personal information about me and keep using that as a weapon against me when all I want to do is either start over as friends as I intended or just stop communicating in whole.,NEGATIVE,0.9999772310256958
